Difficulties
------------
Alot of the difficulties faced when performing this analysis was the lack of command and control server. Since the
command and control server was down, I had to utilize REMNUX as a pseudo command and control server. This allowed REMNUX
to obtain the requests from Proteus which helped further my analysis. It is also interesting to note that the malware
was obfuscated in such a way that it was hard to determine what Windows API functions were being called.
