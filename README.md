Description
-----------
Malware can be very difficult to analyzed. In this project, I analyzed the malware Proteus to better understand how
malware developers hide their programs. In terms of Proteus, there was heavy use of obfuscation that made it difficult
to determine its full capabilities. Most of the details can be read in the report, however, it is important to be
comfortable digging into the assembly when there is heavy obfuscation and potential packing. 

Tools

| Tools | Name | 
| ----- | ---- | 
| VMs | VirtualBox (Windows 10 and REMNUX) |
| Byte Analyzer | Byte Histogram | 
| Debuggers | x32dbg |
| Disassembler | IDA Freeware |
| Executable Verification | Detect It Easy, EXEInfo PE, PEScan | 
| Network | Wireshark, TcpLogView | 
| Process Managers | ProcDot, Process Monitor |  
| Registry Analyzer | RegShot | 

Difficulties
------------
Alot of the difficulties faced when performing this analysis was the lack of command and control server. Since the
command and control server was down, I had to utilize REMNUX as a pseudo command and control server. This allowed REMNUX
to obtain the requests from Proteus which helped further my analysis. It is also interesting to note that the malware
was obfuscated in such a way that it was hard to determine what Windows API functions were being called.
